I am currently learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **TypeScript** to sharpen my problem-solving skills as a full-stack developer. This journey is supported by the **Supreme Batch 3.0** and **Supreme Batch 2.0** courses.

## Courses and Tutors

- **Supreme Batch 3.0 & 2.0**: Comprehensive courses designed to build a strong foundation in DSA with a focus on real-world problems and coding challenges.
- **CodeHelp by Love Babbar**: A popular tutor known for breaking down complex DSA concepts into digestible content and guiding through the right approach.
- **Lakshya Kumar**: A tutor whose lessons have been invaluable in understanding intricate DSA topics.

## Why TypeScript?

As a **full-stack developer**, I chose **TypeScript** for my DSA learning journey because:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures that I catch errors early by enforcing type checks, which helps in preventing common bugs and makes my code more reliable.
- **Seamless Transition**: As a full-stack developer, I already use TypeScript in both front-end (React, Angular) and back-end (Node.js, Express) development. Learning DSA in TypeScript aligns well with my tech stack and workflow.
- **Structured Code**: Features like interfaces, generics, and enums in TypeScript allow me to write more structured and maintainable DSA solutions.
- **Scalability**: TypeScript is ideal for building large-scale applications, and mastering DSA in TypeScript will help me write optimized code that scales well in real-world applications.

## What I Am Learning

The learning process covers:
- Essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs.
- Key algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.
- Solving competitive programming problems to apply DSA concepts in practice.

## Progress

- I am currently advancing through **Supreme Batch 3.0** and revisiting important topics from **Supreme Batch 2.0** for reinforcement.
- Practicing daily DSA problems in **TypeScript** to solidify my knowledge.
